#Icarus
Welcome to Jonathan Trans's Project: Icarus. \
We are excited to see you here! ðŸ˜Š 

Icarus is a tool and platform to analyze pictures of patients who are concerned about skin cancer, acne, and other dermatology problems, detecting whether or not they have it and the spread of the skin problem if they do. We, at Icarus, want to bring out a new product to the public for social good through machine learning and introduce an easier way to interact with dermatologist. 

This project has yet been released to the public and is expected to release fall 2021. More information will be added in the due time.

Tools: HTML, CSS, React Native, Swift, C++, Git/Github, Python (Matplotlib, PyTorch, Pandas, Tensorflow), and more to be added...ðŸ‘»
